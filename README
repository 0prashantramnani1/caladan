Overview
========

base - a extension to the standard C library that provides tools for managing
lists, memory, bitmaps, initialization, atomics, and several other useful
features.

dune - a better implementation of libdune based on the base library.

net - a packet manipulation library.

runtime - a user-level threading and networking runtime.

iokernel - a user-level softNIC.

bindings - language bindings (C++ and rust) for the runtime.


Coding Style
============

Use the following conventions for C code:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html

Use the following conventions for C++ code:
https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html

For third party libraries and tools, use their existing coding style.

For some helpful tips on how to write clean code, see:

Building
========

To build run:
$ make

To build in debug mode run:
$ make clean; make DEBUG=1

To get static checker output:
$ make sparse

For now, eaching binding has its own separate build system.
